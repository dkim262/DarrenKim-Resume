        <p class="lead mb-4">Hi! My name is Darren Kim and I am a second year Economics/Administrative Studies major at the University of California, Riverside (UCR). I am currently in my fourth quarter at the University of California, Riverside (UCR) and it has been great! I hope to graduate within four years, and I am looking forward to finding a career that puts me in a position where I am able to provide service for others.<br><br>

        Currently, I have my many experiences of work has been from working with children at a summer day camp called Camp Toons. I have been volunteering there for the past 6 years and I have enjoyed every bit of it! The experience of being able to spend time with children, take care of them, and teach them has provided me with a skill set that I did not have before. I am able to coordinate, organize, and plan activities with my coworkers in order to execute the day smoothly, for the enjoyment of the kids. I have developed problem-solving abilities by being put into situations that force me to learn and be able to think on the spot. I have also been trained and certified to perform First Aid and Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). I am thankful for the amount of training that I have been given, because it gives me confidence when I am pursuing new jobs. <br><br>

        My experiences of leading have come from being the Team Captain of my high school varsity volleyball team and from managing tours from my instances of being a Block Club Member. As a Team Captain, I was required to be an example and leader for a model of the standard that the team holds. The responsibility of being able to communicate with my peers and my coaches was placed on me, as well as being able to communicate for them as well. I supported my peers through constant words of encouragement, and emotional support. I have learned to take initiative when others do not, and I have learned to be observant of my surroundings and of my interactions with peers. As a Block Club Member, I have been able to develop my interpersonal communication skills and my ability to interact with strangers. Working under stress has taught me to be calm and collected, and to complete the task with a clear conscious rather than to be clouded with stressful thoughts. I am grateful for these experiences and how they have shaped and molded me into the person that I am today. 
<br><br>
        
        Lastly, I am currently participating in AACF (Asian American Christian Fellowship) and serving. I provide technical support during our meetings-dealing with Audio and Visual (AV), as well as setting up and breaking down. I have been trained to use a digital soundboard, and can train others to learn how to use it as well. I am grateful for being able to be apart of Asian American Christian Fellowship because it has helped me grow spiritually and physically as a person. <br><br>
